## SECOND TABLES ##

## UPDATING SEASONS COLUMN TO BE SAME FORMAT AS SEASONS COLUMN IN OTHER TABLE (for relationship in tableau)
## (this was done to only get results from > 1993 for future queries)
-- Remove hyphens from seasons
update ucl_league
set seasons = replace(seasons, 'â€“', ' ');
-- Substring seasons to parts want
update ucl_league
set seasons = SUBSTRING(seasons, 1, 4) + 1;
-- Convert to int
ALTER TABLE ucl_league MODIFY seasons INT;
-- Delete data not included in other table
DELETE FROM ucl_league WHERE seasons < 1993;

-- Which league has the most ucls
SELECT winners_nation, count(seasons) as Championships
from ucl_league
where seasons > 1992
group by winners_nation
order by Championships DESC;

-- Best team in each league
SELECT winners_nation, winners_team, count(seasons) as Championships
from ucl_league
where seasons > 1992
