# UCL-Project
This is a project I did to examine the history of the UEFA Champions league soccer tournament and look into whcih teams and nations have performed the best along with specific performance stats fro each. I used SQL and Tablea for the project and have provided the two data files and sql script below.


## ucl_stats.csv 
Contains data on every team that competed in the UCL since 1993 along with supplementary information about their stats such as wins, losses, goal differential etc.

## ucl_league.csv
Contains data only on the two finalist of the UCL since 1955 but also includes the leagues of each of those teams which I found useful. Focuses on the stats of the championship game as well such as the final score, stadium and attendance count. 

I found it most useful to combined the datasets based on the champions from each year as I was mostly interested in visualizing information about the winnners. 

## UCLScript.sql
The sql script I use to preprocess my data for tableau along with create some queries to preview what I may focus on in my visualizations.
