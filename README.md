# UCL-Project
This project aims to examine the history of the UEFA Champions league soccer tournament and look into which teams and nations have performed the best along with specific performance statistics from each team. I used SQL and Tablea for the project and have provided the two data files, sql script and tablea dashboard below.

## UCL Dashboard.twbx
The dashboard created in tableau showing a breakdown of the top teams throughout the history tournament along with some peroformance statistics. Not sure if you need Tableau Desktop to access the file so I have also provided a link to the Tableau Public page where I have posted the dashboard and can be viewed and downloaded from there.

## UCLScript.sql
The sql script used to preprocess the data for tableau along with create some queries to preview possibly focuses for visualizations.


## Data Sources
## ucl_stats.csv 
Contains data on every team that competed in the UCL since 1993 along with supplementary information about their stats such as wins, losses, goal differential etc.

## ucl_league.csv
Contains data only on the two finalist of the UCL since 1955 but also includes the leagues of each of those teams. Focuses on the stats of the championship game as well such as the final score, stadium and attendance count. 

I found it most useful to combined the datasets based on the champions from each year as I was mostly interested in visualizing information about the winnners.
